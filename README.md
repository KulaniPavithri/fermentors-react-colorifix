Assumptions and Improvements

1. Connected scatter plot multi series graph with tooltip used to visuale data of even properties of fermentation runs on the same graph
2. Displaying details of fermentation runs, I assumed the data of event properties, and status of the fermentation run are more sensible to the user
3. This implementation focused mainly on developing given main functionalities
4. See Fermentor-functionalities.pdf for screenshots of the main functionalities
5. User interface design and UX experience can be improved in many ways - pagination, navigation, responsiveness, etc. Due to time constraints I didn't have time to focus on those areas
